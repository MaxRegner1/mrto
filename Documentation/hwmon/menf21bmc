Description
-----------

The menf21bmc is a Board Management Controller (BMC) which provides an I2C
interface to the host to access the features implemented in the BMC.

This driver gives access to the voltage monitoring feature of the main
voltages of the board.
The voltage sensors are connected to the ADC inputs of the BMC which is
a PIC16F917 Mikrocontroller.

Usage Notes
-----------

This driver is part of the MFD driver named "menf21bmc" and does
not auto-detect devices.
You will have to instantiate the MFD driver explicitly.
Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for
details.
