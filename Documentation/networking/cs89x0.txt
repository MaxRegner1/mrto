===============================================================================


1.1 PRODUCT OVERVIEW

The CS8900-based ISA Ethernet Adapters from Cirrus Logic follow 
IEEE 802.3 standards and support half or full-duplex operation in ISA bus 
computers on 10 Mbps Ethernet networks.  The adapters are designed for operation 
in 16-bit ISA or EISA bus expansion slots and are available in 
10BaseT-only or 3-media configurations (10BaseT, 10Base2, and AUI for 10Base-5 
or fiber networks).  

CS8920-based adapters are similar to the CS8900-based adapter with additional 
features for Plug and Play (PnP) support and Wakeup Frame recognition.  As 
such, the configuration procedures differ somewhat between the two types of 
adapters.  Refer to the "Adapter Configuration" section for details on 
configuring both types of adapters.


1.2 DRIVER DESCRIPTION

The CS8900/CS8920 Ethernet Adapter driver for Linux supports the Linux
v2.3.48 or greater kernel.  It can be compiled directly into the kernel
or loaded at run-time as a device driver module.

2.0 ADAPTER INSTALLATION and CONFIGURATION
===============================================================================

Both the CS8900 and CS8920-based adapters can be configured using parameters 
stored in an on-board EEPROM. You must use the DOS-based CS8900/20 Setup 
Utility if you want to change the adapter's configuration in EEPROM.  

When loading the driver as a module, you can specify many of the adapter's 
configuration parameters on the command-line to override the EEPROM's settings 
or for interface configuration when an EEPROM is not used. (CS8920-based 
adapters must use an EEPROM.) See Section 3.0 LOADING THE DRIVER AS A MODULE.

Since the CS8900/20 Setup Utility is a DOS-based application, you must install 
and configure the adapter in a DOS-based system using the CS8900/20 Setup 
Utility before installation in the target LINUX system.  (Not required if 
installing a CS8900-based adapter and the default configuration is acceptable.)
     

2.1 CS8900-BASED ADAPTER CONFIGURATION

CS8900-based adapters shipped from Cirrus Logic have been configured 
with the following "default" settings:

  Operation Mode:      Memory Mode
  IRQ:                 10
  Base I/O Address:    300
  Memory Base Address: D0000
  Optimization:	       DOS Client
  Transmission Mode:   Half-duplex
  BootProm:            None
  Media Type:	       Autodetect (3-media cards) or 
                       10BASE-T (10BASE-T only adapter)

You should only change the default configuration settings if conflicts with 
another adapter exists. To change the adapter's configuration, run the 
CS8900/20 Setup Utility. 


2.2 CS8920-BASED ADAPTER CONFIGURATION

CS8920-based adapters are shipped from Cirrus Logic configured as Plug
and Play (PnP) enabled.  However, since the cs89x0 driver does NOT
support PnP, you must install the CS8920 adapter in a DOS-based PC and
run the CS8900/20 Setup Utility to disable PnP and configure the
adapter before installation in the target Linux system.  Failure to do
this will leave the adapter inactive and the driver will be unable to
communicate with the adapter.

        ****************************************************************




3.0 LOADING THE DRIVER AS A MODULE
===============================================================================

If the driver is compiled as a loadable module, you can load the driver module
with the 'modprobe' command.  Many of the adapter's configuration parameters can 
be specified as command-line arguments to the load command.  This facility 
provides a means to override the EEPROM's settings or for interface 
configuration when an EEPROM is not used.

Example:

    insmod cs89x0.o io=0x200 irq=0xA media=aui

This example loads the module and configures the adapter to use an IO port base
address of 200h, interrupt 10, and use the AUI media connection.  The following
configuration options are available on the command line:

* io=###               - specify IO address (200h-360h)
* irq=##               - specify interrupt level
* use_dma=1            - Enable DMA
* dma=#                - specify dma channel (Driver is compiled to support
                         Rx DMA only)
* dmasize=# (16 or 64) - DMA size 16K or 64K.  Default value is set to 16.
* media=rj45           - specify media type
   or media=bnc
   or media=aui
   or media=auto
* duplex=full          - specify forced half/full/autonegotiate duplex
   or duplex=half
   or duplex=auto
* debug=#              - debug level (only available if the driver was compiled
                         for debugging)

NOTES:

a) If an EEPROM is present, any specified command-line parameter
   will override the corresponding configuration value stored in
   EEPROM.

b) The "io" parameter must be specified on the command-line.  

c) The driver's hardware probe routine is designed to avoid
   writing to I/O space until it knows that there is a cs89x0
   card at the written addresses.  This could cause problems
   with device probing.  To avoid this behaviour, add one
   to the `io=' module parameter.  This doesn't actually change
   the I/O address, but it is a flag to tell the driver
   to partially initialise the hardware before trying to
   identify the card.  This could be dangerous if you are
   not sure that there is a cs89x0 card at the provided address.

   For example, to scan for an adapter located at IO base 0x300,
   specify an IO address of 0x301.  

d) The "duplex=auto" parameter is only supported for the CS8920.

e) The minimum command-line configuration required if an EEPROM is
   not present is:

   io 
   irq 
   media type (no autodetect)

f) The following additional parameters are CS89XX defaults (values
   used with no EEPROM or command-line argument).

   * DMA Burst = enabled
   * IOCHRDY Enabled = enabled
   * UseSA = enabled
   * CS8900 defaults to half-duplex if not specified on command-line
   * CS8920 defaults to autoneg if not specified on command-line
   * Use reset defaults for other config parameters
   * dma_mode = 0

g) You can use ifconfig to set the adapter's Ethernet address.

h) Many Linux distributions use the 'modprobe' command to load
   modules.  This program uses the '/etc/conf.modules' file to
   determine configuration information which is passed to a driver
   module when it is loaded.  All the configuration options which are
   described above may be placed within /etc/conf.modules.

   For example:

   > cat /etc/conf.modules
   ...
   alias eth0 cs89x0
   options cs89x0 io=0x0200 dma=5 use_dma=1
   ...

   In this example we are telling the module system that the
   ethernet driver for this machine should use the cs89x0 driver.  We
   are asking 'modprobe' to pass the 'io', 'dma' and 'use_dma'
   arguments to the driver when it is loaded.

i) Cirrus recommend that the cs89x0 use the ISA DMA channels 5, 6 or
   7.  You will probably find that other DMA channels will not work.

j) The cs89x0 supports DMA for receiving only.  DMA mode is
   significantly more efficient.  Flooding a 400 MHz Celeron machine
   with large ping packets consumes 82% of its CPU capacity in non-DMA
   mode.  With DMA this is reduced to 45%.

k) If your Linux kernel was compiled with inbuilt plug-and-play
   support you will be able to find information about the cs89x0 card
   with the command

   cat /proc/isapnp

l) If during DMA operation you find erratic behavior or network data
   corruption you should use your PC's BIOS to slow the EISA bus clock.

m) If the cs89x0 driver is compiled directly into the kernel
   (non-modular) then its I/O address is automatically determined by
   ISA bus probing.  The IRQ number, media options, etc are determined
   from the card's EEPROM.

n) If the cs89x0 driver is compiled directly into the kernel, DMA
   mode may be selected by providing the kernel with a boot option
   'cs89x0_dma=N' where 'N' is the desired DMA channel number (5, 6 or 7).

   Kernel boot options may be provided on the LILO command line:

	LILO boot: linux cs89x0_dma=5

   or they may be placed in /etc/lilo.conf:

	image=/boot/bzImage-2.3.48
	  append="cs89x0_dma=5"
	  label=linux
	  root=/dev/hda5
	  read-only

   The DMA Rx buffer size is hardwired to 16 kbytes in this mode.
   (64k mode is not available).


4.0 COMPILING THE DRIVER
===============================================================================

The cs89x0 driver can be compiled directly into the kernel or compiled into
a loadable device driver module.


4.1 COMPILING THE DRIVER AS A LOADABLE MODULE

To compile the driver into a loadable module, use the following command 
(single command line, without quotes):

"gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -I/usr/src/linux/net/inet -Wall 
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -DMODULE -DCONFIG_MODVERSIONS 
-c cs89x0.c"

4.2 COMPILING THE DRIVER TO SUPPORT MEMORY MODE

Support for memory mode was not carried over into the 2.3 series kernels.

4.3 COMPILING THE DRIVER TO SUPPORT Rx DMA

The compile-time optionality for DMA was removed in the 2.3 kernel
series.  DMA support is now unconditionally part of the driver.  It is
enabled by the 'use_dma=1' module option.


5.0 TESTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================================================================

5.1 KNOWN DEFECTS and LIMITATIONS

Refer to the RELEASE.TXT file distributed as part of this archive for a list of 
known defects, driver limitations, and work arounds.


5.2 TESTING THE ADAPTER

Once the adapter has been installed and configured, the diagnostic option of 
the CS8900/20 Setup Utility can be used to test the functionality of the 
adapter and its network connection.  Use the diagnostics 'Self Test' option to
test the functionality of the adapter with the hardware configuration you have
assigned. You can use the diagnostics 'Network Test' to test the ability of the
adapter to communicate across the Ethernet with another PC equipped with a 
CS8900/20-based adapter card (it must also be running the CS8900/20 Setup 
Utility).

         NOTE: The Setup Utility's diagnostics are designed to run in a
         DOS-only operating system environment.  DO NOT run the diagnostics 
         from a DOS or command prompt session under Windows 95, Windows NT, 
         OS/2, or other operating system.

To run the diagnostics tests on the CS8900/20 adapter:

   1.) Boot DOS on the PC and start the CS8900/20 Setup Utility.

   2.) The adapter's current configuration is displayed.  Hit the ENTER key to
       get to the main menu.

   4.) Select 'Diagnostics' (ALT-G) from the main menu.  
       * Select 'Self-Test' to test the adapter's basic functionality.
       * Select 'Network Test' to test the network connection and cabling.


5.2.1 DIAGNOSTIC SELF-TEST

The diagnostic self-test checks the adapter's basic functionality as well as 
its ability to communicate across the ISA bus based on the system resources 
assigned during hardware configuration.  The following tests are performed:

   * IO Register Read/Write Test
     The IO Register Read/Write test insures that the CS8900/20 can be 
     accessed in IO mode, and that the IO base address is correct.

   * Shared Memory Test
     The Shared Memory test insures the CS8900/20 can be accessed in memory 
     mode and that the range of memory addresses assigned does not conflict 
     with other devices in the system.

   * Interrupt Test
     The Interrupt test insures there are no conflicts with the assigned IRQ
     signal.

   * EEPROM Test
     The EEPROM test insures the EEPROM can be read.

   * Chip RAM Test
     The Chip RAM test insures the 4K of memory internal to the CS8900/20 is
     working properly.

   * Internal Loop-back Test
     The Internal Loop Back test insures the adapter's transmitter and 
     receiver are operating properly.  If this test fails, make sure the 
     adapter's cable is connected to the network (check for LED activity for 
     example).

   * Boot PROM Test
     The Boot PROM  test insures the Boot PROM is present, and can be read.
     Failure indicates the Boot PROM  was not successfully read due to a
     hardware problem or due to a conflicts on the Boot PROM address
     assignment. (Test only applies if the adapter is configured to use the
     Boot PROM option.)
